This is an assembly interpreter written in C for the Nintendo DS.
I created this project entirely from scratch as a way for others to
learn to program in a basic assembly language in a portable manner.
Using the top screen of the Nintendo DS/DSi, you can view the
memory and registers of the interpreter live.  Using the right arrow
key, you can go through your program line by line and watch it update,
or you can press the B button to have it perform your full program
without any pauses. I have included some simple test files with
this program.

Please note that this requires the devkitArm and libnds library
that is included in devkitPro to compile.

Please note that NO$GBA cannot run this application due
to the keyboard.  iDeaS runs this fine from what I have tested
however, as does hardware.
