ASM-Interpreter
===============

A simple assembly interpreter.  It can be used to learn the basics of most assembly languages.  It was coded for
the Nintendo DS due to its dual-screen nature.  This means that assembly program's memory and registers can
be shown on one screen, while the currently running code can be shown on another.
